    <h1> Golf is a sport where players use clubs to hit a small ball into a series of holes on a course in the fewest possible strokes, with the modern game originating in Scotland, involving precision, strategy, and patience across varied terrains like fairways, rough, bunkers, and greens, all governed by rules and aiming for a score under "par". Key elements include using different clubs (woods, irons, putters) to manage distances, understanding course layouts (18 holes standard, tee to green), and mastering scoring terms like bogey, par, and birdie, with the goal being the lowest total score.  </h1>
